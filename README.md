This repository showcases a series of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects developed as part of my coursework.

Project 1: CouponAcceptanceAnalysis

This project conducts a detailed analysis of coupon acceptance rates across various venues, focusing on bars and coffee houses. Through exploratory data analysis and strategic data cleaning, it identifies key patterns and factors that influence the likelihood of coupon usage. The project highlights the impact of social factors and visit frequency on coupon acceptance, providing insights that can guide effective marketing strategies.

Project 2: Understanding Factors Influencing Used Car Prices

This project aims to identify key factors that influence the prices of used cars to help dealerships optimize their inventory and pricing strategies. Using a dataset of 426,000 used car listings, we performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and applied multiple regression models to uncover valuable insights. Key findings include the impact of mileage, fuel type, title status, and car type on car prices. Our best-performing model, Polynomial Regression with Ridge, provides actionable recommendations for inventory management, pricing strategies, and targeted marketing. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for used car dealerships to enhance their operational efficiency and profitability.

Project 3: Comparing Classifiers

This project focuses on comparing the performance of several machine learning classifiers - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - on a dataset from a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset contains information on client interactions across multiple marketing campaigns, and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. 

The project involves data processing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, and evaluating the models based on accuracy and other metrics.
